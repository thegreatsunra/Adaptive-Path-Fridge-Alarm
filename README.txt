=============================================

TO INSTALL:

1. Drag the fridge_alarm folder into your Arduino sketchbook. You can find the location of your sketchbook from within the Preferences dialog in the Arduino software.

2. Drag the contents of the libraries folder into the libraries folder in your Arduino sketchbook, if it already exists. If the libraries folder does not exist, create it. More information on installing third-party libraries is available on the Arduino website at http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Environment#libraries

3. Using the Fritzing diagram as a guide, wire up your Arduino. You can download the Fritzing application at http://fritzing.org/download/

4. Open the fridge_alarm sketch in the Arduino software, and upload it to your Arduino. You may need to disconnect pins 0 and 1 to get it to upload correctly.

5. Try and try again, and remember... this is supposed to be fun!
